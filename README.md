# About the project
Using [antlr4](https://www.antlr.org/) I made a tool that can find a person's ancestors or descendants in a [gedcom](https://www.bing.com/search?q=gedcom&cvid=ec9b317358404ed09df51fe39f7da813&tqs=edge..69i57j0l5j69i60j69i61l2j69i11004.2664j0j1&pglt=43&FORM=ANNAB1&PC=HCTS) file.
This is a project for the exam of "Linguaggi e Compilatori" at the Bacheleror Degree in Computer Science at University of Camerino.
